    <h1>About Open Cleveland</h1>
    <p>Open Cleveland is a group of people, first and foremost. We also call ourselves technologists, planners, designers, doers, thinkers, and activists. <a href="http://www.meetup.com/cleveland-civic-hacking/">Every third Wednesday</a>, we actively work together to improve the City of Cleveland and all of Northeast Ohio, often <a href="https://github.com/opencleveland">using technology</a> to support our efforts. By connecting people, organizations, resources, tools, and networks to build for Cleveland, we will all thrive.</p>

    <h2>Brigade</h2>
    <p>Open Cleveland is a local chapter of the <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/">Code for America Brigade</a>, an international network of people committed to using their voices and hands, in collaboration with local governments, to make their cities better.</p>
