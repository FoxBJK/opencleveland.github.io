# A guide for local Cleveland open data

(What is open data?)
Open Data is generally quantative data about the city's functions, qualities, services, its people, and physical infrastructure. The [Sunlight Foundation](<https://sunlightfoundation.com/2013/09/16/your-guidelines-to-open-data-guidelines-pt-2-stages-of-development/) and [Open KNowledge International's Open Data Handbook](<http://opendatahandbook.org/guide/en/what-is-open-data/) are two sources that explain more. 

If you want to do anything useful with the data, the data generally has to be "open": free to obtain, in a file format that is friendly to work with, and to be legally able to use and share with minimal or no restrictions. 

So, many times we want data about our city: where do we start? 
[The US Census](https://www.census.gov/data.html) is most comprehensive source of data about our city, particularly about population and demographics. 

First, ASK the agency that you think would have the data (Advice on that in a later post). 

Cities across the USA have dedicated websites (data portals) . Unfortunately, Cleveland doesn't have one. In this absence, different entities have aggregated or collected this data or perhaps the govt agency that produces or acts as a steward for this data may publish it themselves. 

**geospatial/geographic:**

Also ask your local librarian at your local public library. :)
