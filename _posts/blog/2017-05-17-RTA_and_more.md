April and May has been a busy time for Open Cleveland and our partners here in Cleveland. Here's what happening and where we're going. 

GCRTA, the Greater Cleveland Transit authority, released their (http://www.riderta.com/developers). 

The data includes real-time locations of buses and rails. The released time locations is the result of multiple years of efforts from RTA and encouragement by Open Cleveland
and other advocates. 

Interested to delve more into the data and using RTA's data to improve service and make it easier for fellow Clevelanders to use the service and analyze RTA performance, or any other ideas with the data?   

**Come to our [next hack night on Wednesday, May 24th, at 6:00 PM](https://www.meetup.com/open-cleveland/events/239193067/).**

Need inspiration of how the RTA transit data can be used? The [awesome-transit guide](https://github.com/luqmaan/awesome-transit) has plenty of examples. The real-time bus data is in the [GTFS-RT specification](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs-realtime/).

This week, Will S. will be representing Open Cleveland and fellow Open Cleveland brigader April U. will be representing [The Center on Urban Poverty Center & Neighborhood Development](http://povertycenter.case.edu/) at the NNIP conference in Baltimore. 

Recap: CMHA, the area public housing authority, and Digital C held a [hackathon at CSU on April 7 & 8th](http://clehousinghack.org/) on improving access to Clevelanders in the Housing Choice Voucher program better select well-resourced neighborhoods that meet their needs 

Lastly, Open Cleveland has been collaborating with [Hack Cleveland](http://hackcleveland.org/), [Open NEO](https://openneo.org/), [Digital C](http://digitalc.org/), [Case Urban Poverty Center](http://povertycenter.case.edu/), [Cleveland Co-Lab](http://www.clevelandcolab.com/) and [Cleveland City Councilman Brian Cummins](https://twitter.com/brianjcummins) on events including [Transparency Camp](http://www.opencleveland.org/blog/TCAMP-recap/) and DataDaysCLE ([great synopsis and video of DataDaysCLE](www.greatlakesgeek.com/events/2017/data-days-cle.htm) by Dan Hansen) over the past year. 

Collectively called the Cleveland Open Data & Civic Tech Collaborative, our organizations have been meeting to learn if and how we should formally organize and establish goals, and continue collaborating around our shared interests 
of utilizing data and technology for the public good.
