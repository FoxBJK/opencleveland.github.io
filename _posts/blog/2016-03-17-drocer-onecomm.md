Open Cleveland is excited to announce that we have been named the winner in [OneCommunity's Data Curation Challenge](http://www.meetup.com/Greater-Cleveland-Data-Curation-Group/events/229410937/)! 

**Our project, drocer, is creating a searchable archive of [The City Record](http://clevelandcitycouncil.org/the-city-record/), a weekly digest of Cleveland City Council's activities including proposals and votes of legislation, bid announcements for city contracts, Public Notices, Board of Zoning Appeals, known as the City Record.**

In recent months, we've met with community partners including the Cleveland Public Library, the City Council's Clerk of Courts, and the City's Law Department to get a handle on what it will take to bring this tool to the greatest number of Clevelanders, understand what features are needed and how they can get involved, and enabling Clevelanders to better engage with their City government. 

For more tech saavy and curious readers interested in analyzing the raw plain text that we've extracted from PDFs, you can view the plain text from the as well as our code to improve the parsing and structuring the raw at [https://github.com/opencleveland/drocer](https://github.com/opencleveland/drocer)

Our first step, extracting the raw text from the PDFs is completed! 

Next steps include: 
parsing and structuring the data so that it can be useful to 
continuing to meet with community partners to 


We've only started and the best is yet to come.
