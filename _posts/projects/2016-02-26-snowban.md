Parking is forbidden on certain Cleveland streets when there is more than 2 inches of snow on the ground. Some streets subject to this rule don't have a sign stating this law. 

The city originally published a PDF of the streets. 

We made a map to visually show where these streets. 

### Where we are now: 
* Done (Feb. 2016)
* If you wish to improve the sidebar text or interface of the map, you're welcome to.
