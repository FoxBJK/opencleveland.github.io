    <!-- PTK commenting out until this is finalized <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>FIX THIS PARAGRAPH Code for San Francisco is a safe space for experimentation, learning and practicing skills, taking chances, and asking questions, all to affect and encourage positive change. Whenever possible, we proactively reach out to those who are left out, excluded, ignored, or discriminated against. Those people, in our opinion, represent our most desirable source for experiences, knowledge, and thoughts. We fail without their involvement. Read Code for San Francisco’s <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/document/d/1WcCAWQTfCUhZLqb-AArYDWVWW1E3V96UKDeoIr_3j5s/">2014 strategic plan</a>.</p>-->
