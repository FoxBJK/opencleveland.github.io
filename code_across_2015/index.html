    <h3>Code Across Cleveland</h3>
    
    <p>On Saturday, February 21 from 12 pm to 3 pm we will hold our Code Across Cleveland where we'll discuss what open data and civic apps can do for the residents of Cleveland and all of Northeast Ohio. Ideas we'll discuss:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>See a live demonstration of Large Lots, a website for people to find and buy City-owned vacant lot, streamlining the process.</li>
    <li>Create a searchable index of Cleveland City Council's legislation and updates.</li>
    <li>Use RTA's newly released real-time data to give up-to-date bus schedules.</li>
    <li>Add your own ideas for civic apps!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Learn</p>
    <ul>
    <li>What are open data and civic hacking all about?</li>
    <li>Is Open Cleveland for you?</li>
    <li>If you have an idea of a project that can help improve a local government or have developed a civic app?</li>
    </ul>
    If you're a local govt official or employee, share your experiences with data sharing in your workplace and find out how you can share the data that's available to you and promote open data policies there can help lower costs, streamline citizens' public requests, and more.
